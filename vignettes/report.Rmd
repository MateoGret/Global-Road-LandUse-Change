title: "Global Effects of Road Development on Land-Use Change"

# Introduction

Global road networks are projected to expand by more than 25 million additional paved lane-kilometers by 2050.(Dulac, 2013). Although roads and mobility generate socio-economic benefits, roads also have numerous negative impacts on the environment, ecology, climate and human health and well-being. In particular, research has showed that “the first cut is the deepest”, meaning that the first roads in environmental intact areas are triggering a huge number of environmental problems (Laurance et al., 2009, Laurance et al., 2017). Research has, however, mostly focused on specific interactions, e.g. between road development and deforestation (Kleinschroth and Healey, 2017) or on road development and settlement expansion (Veglio et al., 2025), and has not investigated the effects of roads on land use changes at the global scale.

This project examines how land-use change between 1992 and 2010 is spatially associated with existing road networks in three contrasting regions: Northern Kazakhstan, the Brazilian Cerrado, and West Kalimantan (Borneo). The goal is to identify whether areas closer to roads show stronger transitions toward human-dominated land uses.


# Methods

The methodological approach combines global road infrastructure data with land-use information to explore spatial relationships between roads and land-use change.

First, global land-use data for the years 1992 and 2010 were used to quantify land-use change. For each grid cell, changes in land use between the two time points were calculated. To simplify the analysis and reduce complexity, the original land-use classes were reclassified into two broad categories: used land, including cropland and built-up areas, and unused land, including forests and natural vegetation. This binary classification highlights transitions from natural to human-modified land.

In parallel, road infrastructure variables were derived from the GRIP global road dataset. For each 1 km grid cell, road density was calculated as the total length of roads per unit area. This variable represents the spatial intensity of road infrastructure.

Land-use change metrics and road density were then spatially combined at the grid-cell level. All datasets were cropped to three 2°×2° study regions—Northern Kazakhstan, the Brazilian Cerrado, and West Kalimantan in Borneo—to ensure comparability across contrasting socio-ecological contexts.

Finally, the spatial relationship between road density and land-use change was examined using descriptive and correlation-based analyses. The objective was not to identify causal effects, but to reveal broad spatial patterns and regional differences in how land-use change relates to road density.

# Results

## Summary statistics

To compare the three regions, we calculated the mean built-up change and mean road density for each area. The summary table shows clear differences in both the magnitude of land-use change and the intensity of road infrastructure.

# Discussion

The figures show that built-up change in Kazakhstan is almost negligible. The boxplot values cluster close to zero, and in the scatterplots nearly all points are located near the lower end of the y-axis. Although the trend line indicates a clear positive relationship between road density and built-up change, the absolute magnitude of change remains very small. This pattern is consistent with the post-Soviet context of the region, where population decline, rural out-migration, and the widespread abandonment of agricultural land have reduced overall development pressure. As a result, even areas with relatively high road density exhibit little observable land-use change.

In the Brazilian Cerrado, the figures indicate moderate increases in built-up areas, particularly in locations with higher road density. This is visible in the boxplots, which show higher values compared to Kazakhstan, as well as in the scatterplots, where a slight upward trend can be observed. These patterns align well with real-world processes in the region, where rapid agricultural expansion and continued investment in infrastructure have made accessibility a key factor driving settlement growth and land conversion. Roads play a central role in enabling agribusiness expansion and the development of associated built-up areas at the agricultural frontier.

The strongest land-use changes are observed in West Kalimantan on Borneo. Here, the boxplots contain several high outliers, and the scatterplots display many points at higher values on the y-axis, indicating substantial increases in built-up areas. This pattern reflects well-documented processes in the region, where new roads open up previously intact tropical forests to logging, plantation development, and settlement expansion. In combination with dense natural vegetation and strong economic incentives, improved accessibility leads to rapid land conversion once road infrastructure is established

# Conclusion

Across the three regions, road density proves to be a useful indicator of where land-use change is likely to occur, although its influence depends strongly on regional development dynamics. In Northern Kazakhstan, land-use change remains minimal despite the presence of a clear statistical relationship between road density and built-up change. This pattern reflects the region’s low demographic pressure and limited economic growth, which reduce incentives for large-scale development even in well-connected areas.

In contrast, the Brazilian Cerrado shows moderate increases in built-up areas, particularly in locations with higher road density. This pattern is consistent with the region’s ongoing agricultural expansion, where investments in road infrastructure facilitate agribusiness development, settlement growth, and associated land-use change.

The strongest transformation is observed in West Kalimantan, Borneo. Here, high road density is closely associated with substantial increases in built-up areas. New roads rapidly improve accessibility to previously intact tropical forests, creating conditions that favor logging, plantation expansion, and settlement development.

Overall, the results demonstrate a clear and consistent relationship between road density and land-use change across all three study regions. While built-up growth remains low in most grid cells, it increases systematically in areas with higher road density. The boxplots highlight pronounced regional differences in the magnitude of change, whereas the scatterplots reveal a positive trend between road density and built-up expansion. Together, these findings underline that roads can act as powerful drivers of land-use change, particularly in regions where economic or demographic pressures support development processes.
