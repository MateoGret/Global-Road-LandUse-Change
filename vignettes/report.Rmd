title: "Global Effects of Road Development on Land-Use Change"

# Introduction

Global road networks are projected to expand by more than 25 million additional paved lane-kilometers by 2050.(Dulac, 2013). Although roads and mobility generate socio-economic benefits, roads also have numerous negative impacts on the environment, ecology, climate and human health and well-being. In particular, research has showed that “the first cut is the deepest”, meaning that the first roads in environmental intact areas are triggering a huge number of environmental problems (Laurance et al., 2009, Laurance et al., 2017). Research has, however, mostly focused on specific interactions, e.g. between road development and deforestation (Kleinschroth and Healey, 2017) or on road development and settlement expansion (Veglio et al., 2025), and has not investigated the effects of roads on land use changes at the global scale.

This project examines how land-use change between 1992 and 2010 is spatially associated with existing road networks in three contrasting regions: Northern Kazakhstan, the Brazilian Cerrado, and West Kalimantan (Borneo). The goal is to identify whether areas closer to roads show stronger transitions toward human-dominated land uses.


# Methods

We used GRIP global road data and built-up area layers from the LULC-cube for the years 1992 and 2010. Three 2°×2° regions (Northern Kazakhstan, Brazilian Cerrado, West Kalimantan) were defined as bounding boxes and used to crop all datasets.

Built-up change was calculated as the difference between 2010 and 1992. Road density was derived from the GRIP dataset and resampled to match the land-use grid. For each region, we combined both datasets into a common table containing built-up change, road density, and cell coordinates. These values were used to examine spatial relationships between roads and land-use change.

# Results

## Summary statistics

To compare the three regions, we calculated the mean built-up change and mean road density for each area. The summary table shows clear differences in both the magnitude of land-use change and the intensity of road infrastructure.

# Discussion

Kazakhstan:The figures show almost no built-up change in Kazakhstan: the boxplot values cluster near zero, and the scatterplots place nearly all points low on the y-axis. Although the trend line shows a clear positive relationship between road density and built-up change, the absolute changes are minimal. This aligns with the post-Soviet context: population decline, rural out-migration, and widespread abandonment of agricultural land reduced development pressure. As a result, even well-connected areas experienced little land-use change.
Cerrado:Moderate increases in built-up area occur mainly in well-connected locations. This matches the region’s rapid agricultural expansion, where road improvements support agribusiness, settlement growth, and infrastructure development at the frontier.

Borneo:Borneo shows the strongest land-use changes. The boxplots contain several high outliers, and the scatterplots show many points high on the y-axis, indicating substantial built-up increases. This matches well-documented patterns in the region: new roads open intact tropical forests for logging, plantations, and settlements. Dense vegetation combined with strong economic incentives leads to rapid land conversion once accessibility improves.

Cerrado:The figures display moderate built-up increases in the Cerrado, visible as higher boxplot values and a slight upward trend in the scatterplots. Built-up expansion occurs mainly where road density is higher. This reflects real conditions in the region: rapid agricultural growth and infrastructure investment have made accessibility a key driver of settlement and land conversion. Roads enable the expansion of agribusiness and associated built-up development.

# Conclusion

Across the three regions, road density proves to be a useful indicator of where land-use change is likely to occur, but its influence depends strongly on regional development dynamics. Kazakhstan shows minimal change despite clear statistical trends, reflecting low demographic and economic pressure. In contrast, the Cerrado demonstrates moderate built-up growth in road-accessible areas due to expanding agriculture and infrastructure. Borneo exhibits the strongest transformation, where new roads rapidly trigger forest conversion and settlement expansion.Overall, the results show a clear relationship between road density and land-use change. Across all three figures, built-up growth remains low in most areas, but increases consistently in cells with higher road accessibility. The boxplots demonstrate regional differences in the magnitude of change, while the scatterplots reveal a positive trend between road density and built-up expansion. These findings underline that roads can drive land-use change, especially where economic or demographic pressures support development.
